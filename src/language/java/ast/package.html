The <b>language.java.ast</b> package contains the nodes that make up
the abstract syntax tree (AST) for the Java language.  All classes in
the abstract syntax tree derive directly, or indirectly from the
<code>Node</code> class.

<p>

When the AST is produced, the root level node is an instance of a
<code>CompilationUnit</code> class.  The compilation unit stores
directly or indirectly all the children in the AST.  Children in the
tree can also be retrieved via the <code>chain</code> method on the
<code>CompilationUnit</code> class, which retrieves children in the
tree with the specified label.

<p>

The AST classes and the <code>ASTTraverser</code> interface implement
the Visitor pattern.  The nodes in the tree can be traversed by
implementing the <code>ASTTraverser</code> interface, and passing the
class to the node to the node's <code>accept()</code> method.
